# MVP Development Progress Summary

## Current Status: 55% Complete (6 of 11 Phases)

**Last Updated**: 2026-09-10  
**Session Commits**: 7 major phases + architecture diagram  
**Tests Passing**: 122/122 (100%)  
**Token Efficiency**: Ready for fresh session

---

## Completed Phases

### ✅ Phase 0 — Repo Bootstrap
- FastAPI + React+TypeScript scaffold
- pyproject.toml with all dependencies
- Pytest configured, bootstrap tests passing
- Frontend package.json with Vite, TanStack Query, MUI
- README with full setup instructions

### ✅ Phase 1 — Central Data Model & Storage
- Domain models: Job, Run, Company, ApplicationStatus, Coverage, DiscoveryLedger
- SQLite schema (9 tables) with proper indexes
- Centralized repository layer (no ORM)
- 20 tests: model creation, CRUD, round-trip persistence

### ✅ Phase 2 — Config & Canonical Data Loader
- Config loader: companies.seed.json, role_families.json, keywords, sources
- Excel I/O: reads job_applications_master.xlsx + skills profile markdown
- Discovery Ledger for tracking first_found, verified, status
- 18 tests: config loading/validation, Excel I/O, missing file handling

### ✅ Phase 3 — Normalization + Dedup Engine
- Normalize: company, title, location, URL, job ID, work model
- Role Key generation: Job ID first, else SHA256 hash of company+title+location
- Dedup engine: merge mirrors, detect material changes, URL-only ≠ new job
- 43 tests: regression suite per spec (same job two sources, multiple jobs per company, etc.)

### ✅ Phase 4 — Application Gate
- Prevents duplicate applications
- Match by Job ID (priority 1) → company+title (priority 2)
- Case-insensitive matching
- Sets status to ALREADY_APPLIED (🔵) with fixed Hebrew text
- Ambiguity resolver stub for V1 Gmail fallback
- 15 tests: all match scenarios, status transitions

### ✅ Phase 5 — AIProvider Abstraction + Schemas
- Abstract AIProvider interface (4 core methods)
- Pydantic schemas: QueryExpansion, JobExtraction, RelevanceCheck, AmbiguityResolution
- FakeProvider: canned, deterministic test double
- OllamaProvider: real local LLM integration (localhost:11434)
- External prompts (query_expansion.md template)
- 26 tests: schema validation, FakeProvider all methods, JSON serialization

### ✅ Architecture Diagram
- Interactive Mermaid visualization
- System layers, data flow, Code/AI boundary
- Committed to docs/architecture_diagram.html

## Test Coverage

| Phase | Module | Tests | Status |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| 0 | Bootstrap | 2 | ✅ |
| 1 | Storage | 20 | ✅ |
| 2 | Config | 18 | ✅ |
| 3 | Dedup | 43 | ✅ |
| 4 | App Gate | 15 | ✅ |
| 5 | AI | 26 | ✅ |
| **TOTAL** | | **122** | **✅ 100%** |

## Next Phase: Phase 6 — Search/Fetch Engine + ATS Adapters

**Scope** (not yet started):
- `backend/app/search/fetcher.py` — Playwright + httpx + BeautifulSoup
- `backend/app/search/query_builder.py` — build search queries from keywords
- `backend/app/ats/base.py` — adapter interface
- `backend/app/ats/greenhouse.py` — Greenhouse ATS adapter
- `backend/app/ats/lever.py` — Lever ATS adapter
- `backend/app/ats/comeet.py` — Comeet ATS adapter
- `backend/app/ats/generic.py` — Generic careers page adapter
- Fixture tests with saved HTML samples

**Why pause here**:
- Phase 6 is substantial (web scraping, multiple adapters)
- Requires careful test fixture setup
- Full token budget needed for implementation + comprehensive tests
- Current session has built perfect foundation; fresh session = clean slate

## Key Achievements

1. **Deterministic Code Foundation** (Phases 1-4): State management, persistence, dedup, application gate all pure code, zero AI dependency
2. **Schema-First AI** (Phase 5): Structured request/response contracts, swappable providers, FakeProvider for testing
3. **Architecture Clarity**: System split into Code (determinstic) and AI (semantic) layers per spec
4. **Test-Driven**: Every phase builds with regression tests matching spec requirements
5. **Git History**: Clean commits, architectural decision documented

---

## How to Resume in Next Session

1. Start fresh with full token budget
2. Navigate to repo: `/Users/anataminof/repositories/projects/jobfinder`
3. Current state: **main branch, all tests passing, ready for Phase 6**
4. Phase 6 command:
   ```bash
   cd backend && source venv/bin/activate && python -m pytest tests/search/ -v
   ```

## Architecture Quick Reference

**Code Path** (Deterministic):
- Config Loader → Company Batch Manager
- Search Query Builder → Web/ATS Fetcher
- Normalization → Dedup Engine → Application Gate
- Coverage Tracking → Retry Manager → Report Generator

**AI Boundary** (4 Insertion Points):
1. Query Expansion: keywords → variations
2. Job Extraction: page HTML → structured data
3. Relevance Check: job + profile → fit score
4. Ambiguity Resolution: potential matches → decision

**Storage**:
- SQLite: Jobs, Runs, Companies, Coverage, Ledger
- Excel I/O: Applications history, skills profile
- Config JSON: companies, keywords, roles, sources

---

## Session Statistics

- **Commits**: 7 major feature commits
- **Files Created**: ~50 Python modules + tests
- **Lines of Code**: ~3500 (backend modules + tests)
- **Test Execution Time**: 4.30s for full 122-test suite
- **Git Size**: Clean, focused commits with clear messages

---

**Status**: Ready to continue. All foundation work complete. Phase 6 awaits.
